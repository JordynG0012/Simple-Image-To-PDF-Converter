# Simple-Image-To-PDF-Converter
This script converts an image to a PDF using Pillow and reportlab. It opens the image, gets its dimensions, creates a PDF canvas with those dimensions, draws the image, and saves the PDF. You provide the image and output paths, and running the script generates the PDF with the image content.
